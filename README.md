# K-Means_Driven_Customer_Clustering

 K_Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. The article aims to explore the fundamentals and working of k mean clustering along with the implementation. K means clustering, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters. It starts by randomly assigning the clusters centroid in the space. Then each data point assign to one of the cluster based on its distance from centroid of the cluster. After assigning each point to one of the cluster, new cluster centroids are assigned. This process runs iteratively until it finds good cluster. In the analysis we assume that number of cluster is given in advanced and we have to put points in one of the group. This project focuses on customer segmentation, an essential task in marketing, where the goal is to identify distinct groups within a customer base. These segments allow businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall efficiency. In this project, I implemented K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. The primary objective was to categorize customers into distinct groups, allowing for targeted marketing efforts and personalized customer experiences.
